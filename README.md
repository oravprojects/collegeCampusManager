This project was designed by request to be used by a college or school. 

Administrators can use the system to add users (admin, staff, students) into the system, create academic programs, classes, and schedules, and oversee the chat and forum used by staff and students. 

Lecturers can use the system to view their academic schedules, post announcements, assignments, and grades for their students, take attendance and communicate with students and fellow lecturers through the chat and forum. 

Students can use the system to view their class schedules and academic records, including grades and attendance, as well as view and submit assignments and communicate with lecturers, administrators, and fellow students through the chat and forum. 

A demo version of the project is available at https://stellular-churros-7473a3.netlify.app
